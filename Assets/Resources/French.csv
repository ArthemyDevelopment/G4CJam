Dialog_Intro_1;;Sam: Where am I? What is this place?
Dialog_Intro_2;;"""..."""
Dialog_Intro_3;;Sam: Guess there’s nothing to do but try and get out of here…
Dialog_Mom_1;;Mom: Oh there you are, Sammy!
Dialog_Mom_2;;Mom!? What are you doing here? What even is this place?
Dialog_Mom_3;;Mom: Oh don’t you worry about that, I’m just happy to see you.
Dialog_Mom_4;;Sam: Mom… I think this is a little bit more concerning-
Dialog_Mom_5;;Mom: Don’t be silly. It’s always good to have you around since you work so hard.
Dialog_Mom_6;;Sam: It’s good to be prepared…
Dialog_Mom_7;;Mom: Well, even so… Sammy, we would love to catch up over dinner? 
Dialog_Mom_8;;Sam: I… I’ll think about it, okay, Mom?
Dialog_Mom_9;;Mom: That’s fantastic! I’ll even make your favorite! Oh, take this with you. You might need it later. Keep an eye out for the others.
Dialog_Mom_10;;*You got a companion bat*
Dialog_Mom_11;;Sam: Uh…. thanks? 
Dialog_Mom_12;;Sam *thinking*: This is so weird.
Dialog_Dad_1;;Sam: Oh. You’re here too, Dad.
Dialog_Dad_2;;Dad: Sammy! Hey there, Sport!
Dialog_Dad_3;;Sam: Aaaand you can’t see the spooky forest either. Great.
Dialog_Dad_4;;Dad: How about we go outside and play some catch? You haven’t given baseball a try in awhile.
Dialog_Dad_5;;Sam: That’s because I wasn’t picked for the team…
Dialog_Dad_6;;Dad: Oh forget about that! You love the sport! You can’t let one setback ruin something you loved so much. We can keep practicing together!
Dialog_Dad_7;;Sam: …You’re not mad I didn’t make it first try?
Dialog_Dad_8;;Dad: Of course not! But you will be if you don't  give up.
Dialog_Dad_9;;Sam: Huh… Yeah. I’ll practice with you!
Dialog_Dad_10;;Dad: Great! Oh, don’t forget this. I’ll see you later.
Dialog_Dad_11;;*You got a companion bat!*
Dialog_Dad_12;;Sam: Oh. Another one. Guess I’ll keep looking around.
Dialog_Bandit_1;;Bandit: Hey! Sam! Over here!
Dialog_Bandit_2;;Sam: Bandit? I haven’t seen you since we moved…
Dialog_Bandit_3;;Bandit: Well, yeah… But that doesn’t mean we ever stopped being friends, does it? We can still play games together or watch movies over video calls!
Dialog_Bandit_4;;Sam: Isn’t it weird over a screen?
Dialog_Bandit_5;;Bandit: Only if you make it! But I’d love any excuse to hang out with you! If it is awkward I’ll run all the way over there myself! 
Dialog_Bandit_6;;Sam: Yeah okay… That sounds fun I guess… I really do miss you.
Dialog_Bandit_7;;Bandit: Aww, I miss you too. Let’s keep in touch! Take this with you too!
Dialog_Bandit_8;;*You got a companion bat!*
Dialog_Bandit_9;;Sam: Yeah. We will. I’ll see you around
Dialog_Nicos_1;;Nicos: Hi Sam. How are ya?
Dialog_Nicos_2;;Sam: Nicos. I’m stuck in a creepy forest. How do you think?
Dialog_Nicos_3;;Nicos: Meh *shrugs*
Dialog_Nicos_4;;Sam: Glad to see you’re as responsive as ever…
Dialog_Nicos_5;;Nicos: We both don’t really have big reactions to things. That’s why we get along so well when we have a friend like Bandit.
Dialog_Nicos_6;;Sam: Huh… I guess I thought you were annoyed by my attitude…
Dialog_Nicos_7;;Nicos: What made you think that? We love that about you, Sam. Your sarcasm is hilarious.
Dialog_Nicos_8;;Sam: Oh… Thanks, man.
Dialog_Nicos_9;;Nicos: No problem. Now, you gotta tell me about that new game you’ve been playing at lunch tomorrow. Promise, dude.
Dialog_Nicos_10;;Sam: I promise.
Dialog_Nicos_11;;Nicos: Great! I’ll see you then. Now take this with you too.
Dialog_Nicos_12;;*You got a companion bat!*
Dialog_Nicos_13;;Sam: Yeah, yeah I’m going. Love ya too.
Dialog_Gabe_1;;Gabe: Who goes there?
Dialog_Gabe_2;;Sam: Gabe. It’s me.
Dialog_Gabe_3;;Gabe: Who?
Dialog_Gabe_4;;Sam: Sam.
Dialog_Gabe_5;;Gabe: Who?
Dialog_Gabe_6;;Sam: Your student?
Dialog_Gabe_7;;Gabe: WhHoO?
Dialog_Gabe_8;;Sam: I am not doing this with you again.
Dialog_Gabe_9;;Gabe: *chuckles* I’m just messing with you. You’ve been working very hard, Sam.
Dialog_Gabe_10;;Sam: Yeah, yeah. All A’s is hard work and-
Dialog_Gabe_11;;Gabe: Not just with that. I know moving can be hard and you’ve been facing a lot of trifles in your life since then.
Dialog_Gabe_12;;Sam: It’s fine… I’m fine.
Dialog_Gabe_13;;Gabe: You may say that, but in reality, is anyone really “fine”?
Dialog_Gabe_14;;Sam: Well everyone else…
Dialog_Gabe_15;;Gabe: Everyone struggles with something, Sam. You’re never truly alone. You simply have to look.
Dialog_Gabe_16;;Sam: Is… that why I’ve seen other people with my echolocation?
Dialog_Gabe_17;;Gabe: Perhaps. Maybe reaching out encourages others to do the same.
Dialog_Gabe_18;;Sam: I… guess I never thought about it like that. So… can I go home if I go through this area here?
Dialog_Gabe_19;;Gabe: Indeed. But facing your struggles head on may be difficult alone. Are you sure you feel prepared enough?
Dialog_Gabe_20;;Sam: I’m not sure yet…
Dialog_Gabe_21;;Gabe: Alright then. Either way, I wish you luck Sam, and I hope to keep seeing you strive both inside and outside my classroom. Take this.
Dialog_Gabe_22;;*You got a companion bat!
Dialog_Gabe_23;;Sam: Thanks, Mr. Gabe
Dialog_Gabe_24;;Gabe: Who?
Dialog_Gabe_25;;Sam: NO.
Dialog_Gabe_26;;Gabe: *chuckles* You’re so easy to tease. Carry on. But don’t forget that you can always start over if needed. These things can take as long as you need, and this is not the end.
Dialog_Gabe_27;;Sam: Sure. Thank you for everything. All of you.
Dialog_Monster_1;;Monster: So you’ve finally made it to me. I’m surprised considering you can’t get out of your own head.
Dialog_Monster_2;;Monster: I doubt that’d get you very far. You can’t even leave your room half the time.
Dialog_Monster_3;;Monster: And what about dear old dad? He taught you everything about sports and yet you can’t make the team? How useless!
Dialog_Monster_4;;Monster: Hmm. Moving has likely left you stranded and alone. Poor Bandit. You’ll never see them again.
Dialog_Monster_5;;Monster: Nicos doesn’t really like you. You’re mean and sarcastic. Who would want a friend like that?
Dialog_Monster_6;;Monster: Mr. Gabe only gets along with you so much because you do so well in his class. You’d be nothing if you couldn’t succeed.
Dialog_Monster_7;;Monster: Um-
Dialog_Monster_8;;Monster: You really think they care? That you matter?
Dialog_Monster_9;;Monster: I AM right. That’s what I’ve been telling you all along.
Dialog_Sam_Win_1;;Sam: Well, clearly that’s what I’m trying to do weird… nightmare… blob thingy.
Dialog_Sam_Win_2;;Sam: It’s a safe space… Besides. My mom will always be waiting for me when I’m ready to come out.
Dialog_Sam_Win_3;;Sam: Dad spends time playing with me because he loves me. Not so he can succeed through me.
Dialog_Sam_Win_4;;Sam:  I love baseball and I love playing with my dad. I’m not gonna let that ruin it for me.
Dialog_Sam_Win_5;;Sam: The internet exists. But even so, Bandit is still with me and the fun times we had will never fade. Even if there’s distance between us.
Dialog_Sam_Win_6;;Sam: If Nicos didn’t accept me for who I am then he wasn’t a friend to begin with. But he does. He loves being my friend and I love being his.
Dialog_Sam_Win_7;;Sam: Succeeding doesn’t equate to my worth as a person. Mr. Gabe knows that. That’s why he’s supported me for so long, even now when I’m struggling.
Dialog_Sam_Win_8;;Sam: Actually… that’s it.. That’s what my mind’s been showing me this whole time. It’s not just Mr. Gabe… 
Dialog_Sam_Win_9;;Sam: Everyone here has been trying to support me. I just… wasn’t ready to see it. Wasn’t ready to ask for help.. But now I am.
Dialog_Sam_Win_10;;Sam: Of course I do. And I won’t let you consume me anymore. I’m going home.
Dialog_Sam_Lose_1;;Sam: Well, clearly that’s what I’m trying to do weird… nightmare… blob thingy.
Dialog_Sam_Lose_2;;Sam: You don’t know what you’re talking about…
Dialog_Sam_Lose_3;;Sam: He did seem pretty upset.
Dialog_Sam_Lose_4;;Sam: Bandit…
Dialog_Sam_Lose_5;;Sam: It’s just how I am… but…
Dialog_Sam_Lose_6;;Sam: … Maybe you’re… right…
Dialog_Sam_Lose_7;;Sam: No.. NO!
Dialog_Sam_Lose_8;;Sam: Where am I? What is this place?
